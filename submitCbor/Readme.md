# getTxs

Ok so you probably found out that Nami is awesome and want to get information about the address, balance and the transactions available?
Well in this example if Nami is enabled you create a Table with transactions ids, ADA amount of each transaction and the assets included in the transactions.
The example decodes the address in human readable form (bech32) and display the amount of ADA available


Everything is done in javascript, have fun
